	platform/tools/base

From the commit 27910857387deaff54a233258d3ca56c1600c98f

Note: Before dropping the ddmlib-prebuilt.jar, please run
the following command to strip the jar manifest file,
which causes hidden dependency on jars in the Class-Path.
$ zip -d ddmlib-prebuilt.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
