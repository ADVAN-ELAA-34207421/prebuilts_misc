The object in this prebuilt directory is a copy of the jar from
	platform/tools/base

From the commit 9f14c9848acca0fd948ebeff80153e0cfc7592c5

Note: Before dropping the ddmlib-prebuilt.jar, please run
the following command to strip the jar manifest file,
which causes hidden dependency on jars in the Class-Path.
$ zip -d ddmlib-prebuilt.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
