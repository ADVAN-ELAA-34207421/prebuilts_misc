The android-support-test object in this prebuilt directory can be rebuilt from
	platform/frameworks/testing/support

From the revision 32f8bbf84d78eead862ef613a64a052e80b91dc9

TODO: We have different revisions, because at this point we could only update
the espresso prebuilts. Updating android-support-test requires changes to the
tests. We should move this forward so we can keep a single version.

Espresso objects can be rebuilt from
	platform/frameworks/testing/support on ub-support-test branch
